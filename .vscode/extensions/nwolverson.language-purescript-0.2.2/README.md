Syntax highlighting and snippets for [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org) language files (`.purs`) based on the [Atom Grammar](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/atom-language-purescript)
(which is also used for GitHub syntax highlighting) and [atom-language-purescript](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/atom-language-purescript) snippets. **Both the grammar and snippets in this repository are generated from atom-language-purescript**

See [ide-purescript](https://github.com/nwolverson/vscode-ide-purescript) for psc-ide based
"IDE" support (autocomplete, import management, suggestions, etc).

See [input-assist](https://github.com/freebroccolo/vscode-input-assist) for Unicode input assistance
on autocomplete which is known to work with this extension, alternatively [unicode-latex](https://github.com/ojsheikh/unicode-latex)
which offers similar LaTeX based input vi a lookup command.
